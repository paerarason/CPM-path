## HEAP IMPLEMENTATION WITH 2^N CHILD ðŸ‘¶

```sh
   go run .
```
### Task is to implement a novel data structureÂ - project called as a power of two max heap. 
The requirements of the data structure are as follows:
- The heap must satisfy the heap property.
- Every parent node in the heap must have 2^x children.
- The value of x must be a parameter of the heapâ€™s constructor.
- The heap must implement an insert method.
- The heap must implement a pop max method.
- The heap must be performant.
- You must use a more descriptive variable name than x in your implementation.
